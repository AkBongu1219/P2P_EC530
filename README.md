# Peer-to-Peer Messaging System

This Python project implements a local Peer-to-Peer (P2P) messaging system with integrated offline handling and automation features. Each peer can send, receive, and schedule messages seamlessly over a local network.

## Features

- **P2P Communication:**  
  Real-time messaging between multiple peers running locally.

- **SQLite Database Integration:**  
  Messages are persistently stored in a local SQLite database with details such as timestamps, sender, receiver, status, and message content.

- **Offline Support:**  
  Messages sent to offline peers are automatically queued and delivered once the peer reconnects.

- **Message Automation and Scheduling:**  
  Schedule messages for future delivery at specific dates and times.

- **Notification Support:**  
  Desktop notifications for incoming messages (macOS and cross-platform via plyer).
